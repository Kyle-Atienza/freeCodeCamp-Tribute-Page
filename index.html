                        One such visionary is Gina Lopez.  She may have been called a lot of glowing names but there were also not a few people who found her eccentric, to say the very least. Stubborn and unreasonable to some. “Na buang na” was what one Facebook commenter posted when footage of her singing “I Believe I Can Fly” made the rounds of social media. But it is undeniable: Gina Lopez was one extraordinary person.

                        <p>Lopez also initiated the rehabilitation of the Pasig River and nearby urban streams through the Kapit Bisig para sa Ilog Pasig project.[9] once considered as the lifeline of the Filipino nation, the Pasig River is one of the most polluted and toxic river systems in the Philippines today. For her efforts in rehabilitating the river, she was appointed in 2010 by President Benigno Aquino III as the Chairperson of the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission. Her efforts in the commission led to a river rehabilitation revolution which cleansed numerous tributaries in the Pasig river system. She was also responsible for the reforestation of the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, the last remaining forest zone in Metro Manila.</p>
